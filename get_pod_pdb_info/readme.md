# Pod & PDB Inspector

A tiny, zero-dependency (beyond kubectl + jq) script that scans every Pod in your cluster, finds the matching PodDisruptionBudget (PDB), and prints a neat table and a proper CSV. It also resolves the Pod‚Äôs PriorityClass and includes the numeric priority value.

Perfect for disruption planning, SLO reviews, and ‚Äúwhy did this pod get evicted?‚Äù debugging.

‚∏ª

‚ú® Features
	‚Ä¢	Cluster-wide view of Pods and their matching PDB (by matchLabels).
	‚Ä¢	PriorityClass lookup: prints both name and numeric value.
	‚Ä¢	Two outputs, one run: human-readable TSV to STDOUT and a machine-friendly CSV file.
	‚Ä¢	Safe by default: robust handling of Pods without labels or missing PDB/priority.

‚∏ª

üì¶ Requirements
	‚Ä¢	kubectl (configured to talk to your cluster)
	‚Ä¢	jq


üöÄ Quickstart
	1.	Save the script as get_pod_pdb_info.sh.
	2.	Make it executable:
```
chmod +x ./get_pod_pdb_info.sh
```


	3.	Run it (default CSV path: ./pod-disruptions.csv):
```
./get_pod_pdb_info.sh
```


	4.	Choose a custom CSV path:
```
./get_pod_pdb_info.sh --csv /tmp/pod-disruptions-$(date +%F).csv
```

üßæ Output

Columns
	1.	POD_NAME ‚Äì Pod name
	2.	NAMESPACE ‚Äì Pod namespace
	3.	REPLICASET ‚Äì Owning ReplicaSet name (or N/A)
	4.	PRIORITY_CLASS ‚Äì PriorityClass name (or N/A)
	5.	PRIORITY_VALUE ‚Äì Numeric PriorityClass value (or N/A)
	6.	PDB_NAME ‚Äì Matching PDB (or N/A)
	7.	MIN_AVAILABLE ‚Äì PDB spec.minAvailable (or N/A)
	8.	MAX_UNAVAILABLE ‚Äì PDB spec.maxUnavailable (or N/A)

üõ†Ô∏è How it works
	1.	Fetches:
	‚Ä¢	kubectl get pods -A -o json
	‚Ä¢	kubectl get pdb -A -o json
	‚Ä¢	kubectl get priorityclass -o json
	2.	Joins pods ‚Üí PDBs using jq, matching namespace and PDB‚Äôs spec.selector.matchLabels ‚äÜ pod labels.
	3.	Looks up the PriorityClass name and value for each Pod.
	4.	Emits:
	‚Ä¢	A pretty TSV table to STDOUT.
	‚Ä¢	A quoted CSV file to the path you choose.

Note: The current matcher uses PDB matchLabels. If your PDBs rely on matchExpressions, extend the jq selector logic accordingly.


üêû Troubleshooting
	‚Ä¢	jq: error ... Cannot index string with string "spec"
This occurs when the context inside a jq all(...) becomes a key string. The script fixes this by capturing the PDB as $pdb and referencing $pdb.spec... explicitly.
	‚Ä¢	No PDB shown (N/A)
The Pod‚Äôs labels don‚Äôt match any PDB matchLabels in the same namespace‚Äîverify your selectors.
	‚Ä¢	Priority value is N/A
The Pod has no priorityClassName, or the PriorityClass doesn‚Äôt exist/wasn‚Äôt readable.

‚∏ª

üß≠ Tips
	‚Ä¢	Want to scope to one namespace? Replace kubectl get pods -A with kubectl -n <ns> get pods and do the same for PDBs (drop -A).
	‚Ä¢	For portability, consider #!/usr/bin/env bash as your shebang on systems where /usr/bin/bash isn‚Äôt present.
